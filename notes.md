# Notes

## From Hito's tutorial
- _More_ mystery if you want myth. The beginning is too detailed. Green Camp should be written as a utopia (which has no location). It should be a mysterious heaven. 
-- Part of this should be Green Camp has a magical panacea to Cooper's problems... "If we never sold Green Camp, we would be okay"
- Or focus intently on what _exactly_ the memory is. No speculation, no research, just what the memory says (this seems like a different project, then. I would have to scrap everything that uses Google Maps)
-- Include memories/testimonials from alumni, but sense half of what they're saying or something. Something visual that obscures Green Camp because Green Camp cannot be imaged.
- "These places were so great, you'll never understand" → "nostalgia"
-- "So fragmented and ridiculous to talk this way, so the format makes sense to match it" I.e. that narrative structure can be interrupted
- Lead to dead-ends and speculations more. The whole document needs to be bigger, a bigger web
- Formally emphasize the inaccessibility of Green Camp
-- Not important to have a photo of it, you should find ways to formally block out the appearance
- Give the user a number of options to decided if it's good whether or not Green Camp is now Green RCH
-- Contradict points using tangents
- Explore the relations between the prison-industrial complex and the art education industrial complex
-- That this "upper middle class" juvenile detention center takes money to "rehabilitate" and introduce art at a young age so that  the youth can go to spend money at art school. This seems far-fetched now, but it made sense during the tutorial. I must be missing something.
-- Do these two industries support each other? Does the education-industrial complex disenfranchise people and perpetuate circumstances that feed the prison-industrial complex (e.g. ghettos, racism, public resources)?
--- "Tuition is racist"
-- Word play on "camp" → camp as a recreational space, camp as a prison
--- Present day: the actual Green Camp (or the remnants of it) is a prison, Green Camp as a memory is also a prison (cannot enter or exit at will, product of an industrial complex)
-- Also that prisons cannot be imaged, like how Green Camp cannot be imaged because it cannot be reached
--- Once we discover Green Camp is a juvenile correction home, the imagery should change. It should be formally clear that we are not allow to enter the space, to image it. The can be achieved in a few ways
---- Blocking or censoring photos you've taken
---- Photographing at the boundary of where you can take photos
---- Relying on imagery _they_ provide (very little, but that could be good to keep repeating the same photo)
---- Stock imagery
---- Third party imaging (e.g. Google Maps)
