            <p>Before things were the way they are now, we had a place to go.</p>
            <p>Working against tuition brought us together with alumni who had been there first hand. They told us all the stories. Green Camp wove seamlessly into the philosophy of our school: a modest set-up activated by a community working together. They told us about the bus that would deliver them into the woods, where they could escape the concrete and brick of the city. They told us how ideas and collaborations spurred on the lawn or by the river. They told us how Green Camp was as important as the school itself to their education.</p>
            <!-- what's something mythological about a free Cooper that could be used to describe Green Camp? -->
            
            <p>There was something special about those woods—something they can't seem to really describe. It was an experience, apparently.</p>

                <p>Green Camp would appear spontaneously in conversations about Cooper's cornucopia of problems. Someone says something reductive: they have a solution to some issue, any issue. "If only we cut the president's salary, we would be fine!" Someone else nullifies the solution with context for a larger issue, then they reductively offer a solution to larger context. "It's not just this president. George Campbell's retirement package topped Top 5 lists. We need to trim down the whole administration!" Then it repeats. "It's not just cutting spending, it's bringing in <b>sustainable</b> revenue. Why are we always making one-time sales?"</p>

                <p>Green Camp became a premonition of the soon-to-be New Cooper Union. It was a destroyed utopia. Green Camp was something good turned in for money. We felt that once Green Camp had been lost, it could only exist in a youthful idealism.</p>
                <p><i>Yes, obviously a Green Camp would be great, but pragmatically it just can't work. The poetics are nice, but the fact of the matter is that Green Camps cost money—money we don't have. That's the problem with this generation: they think they deserve all these privileges. Green Camps are a privilege, not a right.</i></p>
                <p>And that's when it became apparent that no one talked about present-day Green Camp. Maybe Green Camp still exists somewhere, out there. Maybe Green Camp exists for another institution. If we can find Green Camp still exists, maybe our other idealisms won't seem so far-fetched. If we can find Green Camp, maybe I will feel grounded.</p>
