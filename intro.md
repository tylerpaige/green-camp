This is a slideshow that goes in multiple directions. As a slideshow, it should function in an independent viewing (where any viewer has control of the duration and progression of the narrative), or it should function as a performance. I think both of those functions are in this, but the independent viewing does not work well with a classroom presentation. Therefore I will be performing this. If you would rather experience and independent viewing, here is the URL to the slideshow online. It's quite image heavy and UdK's wifi is pretty slow, so be patient. If the page seems to be done loading and the images are still not there, refresh the page.

I am now going to go through the slideshow in my chosen narrative progression. It is not the only way through the slideshow, but it is the way I will present it.
