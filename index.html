            <p>Green Camp had been built up as a mythology. Though Cooper sold it off in the 1970s, working against tuition brought us together with alumni who had been there first hand. They spoke about it so romantically, giving us a false nostalgia—a yearning for a past with which we had no connection. After all, Cooper Union had been selling off properties to cover its deficits for decades. Green Camp was just another casualty, something that could bear to be erased from the institution.</p>
            <p>But Green Camp turned out to be different. Green Camp wasn't erased from the institutional memory. People fought to preserve that.</p>
            <p>Initially, they fought to preserve Green Camp the actual. Students resisted Green Camp's sale, and they prevented it for two years—apparently. No one really talks about that.</p>

            <p>Green Camp would appear spontaneously in conversations about Cooper's cornucopia of problems. Someone says something reductive: they have a solution to any issue. "If only we cut the president's salary, we would be fine!" Someone else nullifies the solution with context for a larger issue, then they reductively offer a solution to larger context. "It's not just this president. George Campbell's retirement package topped Top 5 lists. We need to trim down the whole administration!" Then it repeats. "It's not just cutting spending, it's bringing in <b>sustainable</b> revenue. Why are we always making one-time sales?"</p>
            <p>Then someone mentions Green Camp.</p>

            <p>Green Camp became a premonition of the soon-to-be new Cooper Union. It was a destroyed utopia. Green Camp was something good turned in for money. We felt that once Green Camp had been lost, it could only exist in a youthful idealism. Yes, obviously a Green Camp would be great, but pragmatically it just can't work. The poetics are nice, but the fact of the matter is Green Camps cost money—money we don't have. This is the problem with this generation: they think they deserve all these privileges. Green Camps are a privilege, not a right.</p>
            <p>And that's when it became apparent that no one talked about present-day Green Camp. Maybe Green Camp still exists somewhere, out there. Maybe for another institution. If we can find Green Camp still exists, maybe our other idealisms won't be so far-fetched. If we can find Green Camp, maybe I will feel grounded.</p>
            <p>So we began a search for Green Camp inside of Cooper Union. Green Camp the actual may have been lost—forfeited—but traces of it still existed inside the institution. Alumni made books about it. We found a silent film in the library film archives.</p> <!-- this could be a separate slide with a photo of the green camp book in the lubalin center -->

            <p>Somehow the images were shocking. I wanted to think Green Camp was real, but somewhere deep down I must have convinced myself Green Camp was impossible. But here it was! This was Green Camp recorded on film! This record proved me simultaneously right and wrong! What ambivalence!</p>

            <p>But they were, after all, archives. These documents proved Green Camp exist<i>ed</i>, but not that it currently exist<i>s</i>. We tried to find ourselves in the films, but we couldn't do it seamlessly. And then it dawned on us: maybe Green Camp needed a new document. Maybe we had to seek out Green Camp the actual in existence—the place.</p>
            <p>No one seemed to know what Green Camp was presently. No one could say what happened to Green Camp after it was sold. The institutional memory simply stopped after 1973. If for no other reason, we wanted to find Green Camp for closure. We were so used to finding another container, a larger trouble, a bigger boss. Happy ending or not, we needed an end to <i>some</i>thing.</p>

            <p>We used the archived material and the stories we heard to find Green Camp. We knew it was in the Ramapo Mountains in New Jersey, in a town called Ringwood. Green Camp was likely some green colored space on a map, we thought. I don't suppose we ever considered it could have been torn down for condos or a Wal-Mart.</p>
