            <!--<p>Before things were the way they are now, we had a place to go.</p>-->
            <p>Cooper Union sold it a few decades ago, but working against tuition brought us together with alumni who had actually been there first hand. They told us all the stories. Green Camp wove seamlessly into the philosophy of our school: a modest set-up activated by a community working together. They told us about the bus that would deliver them into the woods, where they could escape the concrete and brick of the city. They told us how ideas and collaborations spurred on the lawn or by the river. They told us how Green Camp was as important as the school itself to their education.</p>
            <!--<img src="images/what-was-green-camp.png" />-->
            <p>There was something special about those woods—something they can't seem to really describe: something we wouldn't ever really understand, apparently.</p>

                    <p>Green Camp would appear spontaneously in conversations about Cooper's array of problems. Someone says something reductive: they have a solution to some issue, any issue. "If only we cut the president's salary, we would be fine!" Someone else nullifies the solution with context for a larger issue, then they reductively offer a solution to larger context. "It's not just this president. George Campbell's retirement package topped Top 5 lists. We need to trim down the whole administration!" Then it repeats. "It's not just cutting spending, it's bringing in <b>sustainable</b> revenue. Why are we always making one-time sales?"</p>

                    <p>Green Camp became a premonition of the soon-to-be New Cooper Union. It was a destroyed utopia. Green Camp was something good turned in for money. We felt that once Green Camp had been lost, it could only exist in a youthful idealism.</p>
                    <p><i>Yes, obviously a Green Camp would be great, but pragmatically it just can't work. The poetics are nice, but the fact of the matter is that Green Camps cost money—money we don't have. That's the problem with this generation: they think they deserve all these privileges. Green Camps are a privilege, not a right.</i></p>
                    <p>And that's when it became apparent that no one talked about present-day Green Camp. Maybe Green Camp still exists somewhere, out there. Maybe Green Camp exists for another institution. If we can find Green Camp still exists, maybe our other idealisms won't seem so far-fetched. If we can find Green Camp, maybe I will feel grounded.</p>

                    <p>But they were, after all, archives. These documents proved Green Camp existed, but not that it currently exists. We tried to find ourselves in the films, but we couldn't do it seamlessly. And it became clear: Green Camp needed a new document. Maybe we had to seek out Green Camp the actual in existence—the place.</p>
                    <p>No one seemed to know what Green Camp was presently. No one could say what happened to Green Camp after it was sold. The institutional memory simply stopped after 1973. If for no other reason, we wanted to find Green Camp for closure. We were so used to finding another container, a larger trouble, a bigger boss. We needed an end to something, for once.</p>

Maybe this is a more perfect form of education: a modest space that everyone can activate, not just those who were admitted. Green Camp's sale might have opened its doors! Not closed them!</p>

                        <p>Green Residential Community Home is located in rural Passaic County on the grounds of Ringwood State Park. It is a residential facility for younger male juvenile offenders between the ages of 13-16. The center serves a maximum of 32 residents.</p>
                        <p>The program’s goal is to provide a safe, secure, and structured environment where program participants learn to modify their behaviors and reactions; utilizing A.R.T. (Aggression Replacement Training), and other proven treatment modalities. Through these concepts, residents learn to adapt to change, accept accountability, and develop self-discipline. Individual and group counseling is provided by a contracted Psychologist and Psychiatrist.</p>
                        <p>The staff, acting as role models, instill a sense of espirit de corps <i>[sic]</i>, teach realistic goal setting and promote responsible decision making. The residents learn to adapt to change, accept accountability and develop self-discipline.</p>
                        <p>Through a contract with the Playwright's Theater of New Jersey, residents are instructed in the writing and performance of one-act plays. Performances take place at the Playwright's Theater in Madison, New Jersey.</p>
                        <p>In addition, residents perform daily community service work on the grounds of Ringwood State Park and Ringwood Manor. The young men of Green RCH also provide assistance to the municipal government, ambulance corps, fire department, a local battered women's shelter and maintain one of the town's main roads through the Adopt-A-Road Program.</p>

                            <p>Is it ironic that Green RCH hopes to teach esprit de corps: to maintain belief in an institution? Green Camp tried, but it only worked for a few years. After a few years, people lose that conviction. Everybody insists on doing the past better than ever before.</p>
                            <p>Do you think Green RCH has that same kind of collegiate esprit de corps that has been the hallmark of traditional undergraduate institutions? Green Camp lasted 34 years before the esprit de corps faded out. Green RCH has been around for 39 years. Maybe the same will happen to them soon. Maybe the state will start questioning why they want to create more playwrights and performers, and they'll slash funding for Green RCH.</p>
                            <p>I suppose these places exist in generations. </p>

                                <p>But maybe there's some economic opportunity in these young offenders. They are categorized as misbehavior and sent to Green RCH, where they are instilled in <i>A.R.T.</i> and <i>esprit de corps</i>. The theaters and the parks get free labor from these young men's personal enrichment. Then they discover a passion for the arts, and they apply for an arts university. Then they are handed a $200,000 bill and a BFA.</p>
